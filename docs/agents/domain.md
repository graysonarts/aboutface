# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This repo is **single-context** — one glossary and one ADR directory at the root:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md                         ← not created yet
├── docs/adr/                          ← not created yet
│   ├── 0001-<decision>.md
│   └── 0002-<decision>.md
├── annotators/                        ← the per-annotator executables
└── common/                            ← the shared aboutface_common library
```

If this ever splits into genuinely separate contexts, add a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md`
pointing at one `CONTEXT.md` per context and re-run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
